        Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by high blood sugar
        levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms often include frequent urination, increased
        thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications.

        Type 1 diabetes results from the pancreas's failure to produce enough insulin due to
        loss of beta cells. Type 2 diabetes begins with insulin resistance, a condition in
        which cells fail to respond to insulin properly. As the disease progresses, a lack
        of insulin may also develop.

        Treatment includes lifestyle modifications, medication, and insulin therapy. Regular
        monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential. The target HbA1c level for most
        adults with diabetes is below 7%. Complications include cardiovascular disease,
        stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, damage to the eyes, and cognitive
        impairment.

        Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg
        or diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mmHg. It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular
        disease, stroke, and kidney disease.

        First-line treatments include lifestyle modifications: weight loss, DASH diet (rich
        in fruits, vegetables, whole grains), reduced sodium intake (<2300mg/day), regular
        physical activity (150 minutes/week moderate intensity), and limited alcohol consumption.

        Pharmacological treatment is recommended for patients with BP ≥140/90 mmHg or those
        with cardiovascular risk factors at ≥130/80 mmHg. First-line medications include
        ACE inhibitors, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. Target BP
        is <130/80 mmHg for most patients.

        COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Common symptoms include fever, cough,
        fatigue, loss of taste or smell, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache.
        Symptoms typically appear 2-14 days after exposure.

        Most cases are mild and can be managed at home with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter
        medications for symptom relief. Severe cases may require hospitalization for oxygen
        therapy or mechanical ventilation.

        Prevention includes vaccination, wearing masks in crowded indoor spaces, hand hygiene,
        and maintaining physical distance. Antiviral treatments like Paxlovid may be prescribed
        for high-risk patients within 5 days of symptom onset.

        Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable
        and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms
        include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.

        Diagnosis is based on clinical history, physical examination, and spirometry showing
        reversible airflow obstruction (≥12% improvement in FEV1 after bronchodilator).

        Treatment follows a stepwise approach. Quick-relief medications (short-acting beta
        agonists like albuterol) are used for acute symptoms. Controller medications include
        inhaled corticosteroids (first-line), long-acting beta agonists, and leukotriene
        modifiers. Severe asthma may require biologic therapies targeting specific inflammatory
        pathways.

        Drug interactions can significantly affect medication efficacy and safety. Common
        interaction types include pharmacokinetic (affecting absorption, distribution,
        metabolism, excretion) and pharmacodynamic (affecting drug action at receptor sites).

        Notable interactions to monitor:
        - Warfarin with NSAIDs: increased bleeding risk
        - ACE inhibitors with potassium supplements: hyperkalemia risk
        - Statins with grapefruit juice: increased statin levels
        - SSRIs with MAOIs: serotonin syndrome risk
        - Metformin with contrast dye: lactic acidosis risk

        Healthcare providers should review all medications including OTC drugs and supplements.
        Patients should be educated about potential interactions and warning signs.
